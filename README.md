### Solution

### Retrospective

- Keeping track of the logic for this project was a nice challenge!
- The many different state changes also meant experimenting with functional programming, i.e., breaking apart tasks into singular or standalone functions
- Another learning was considering the accessibility implications of the app: making sure the right elements and attributes were used; visual changes were intuitive; and that keyboard navigation worked
- What could be improved is DRYing out the code for the input field event handlers

### Enhancement(s)

- Refactoring input field event handlers
